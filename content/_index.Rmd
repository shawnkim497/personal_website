<p>
I am a Political Science PhD Candidate at Stony Brook University. I am primarily interested in behavioral political economy. I am interested in how social preferences and beliefs play roles in collective actions, redistributive policies, and other political behaviors. I use a variety of methods, including experiments, machine learning, and agent-based modeling. My dissertation focuses on how people make tradeoffs between other peopleâ€™s personal freedoms and what is best for society overall. I am also the  [Center for Behavioral Political Economy](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/cbpe/) lab manager at Stony Brook University.

Although the theme has advanced a little bit and it now allows to specify the content on the main page (even if the list of posts/articles is not intended).
This can be:
- with the list of posts/articles (default: `mainSections = ["post"]) or
- without the list of posts/articles (by setting `mainSections = [""]`)

Markdown supported, ie:
