<h1>About me</h1>
</div>
<p>
I am an advanced Ph.D. candidate in the <a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu/polsci/"><strong>Department of Political Science </strong></a>at Stony Brook Univeristy (dissertation to be defended by May 2023). My research, broadly speaking, focuses on race, ethnicity and politics (REP), political behavior, and political psychology in American politics. While my general interests are not confined to any particular racial or ethnic group, my dissertation research dissertation research focuses on Asian Americans, the fastest-growing demographic group in America. Political scientists have shown increased research interests in Asian Americans' political behavior. Nevertheless, considerable skepticism remains over more fundamental questions about Asians, such as the capacity for pan-Asian cooperation and political solidarity in the US. To advance research in this area, my dissertation tackles the following questions: how do Asians in the US form an inclusive collective ingroup given considerable heterogeneity among different subgroups (e.g., Lee and Ramakrishnan 2020); how does this heterogeneity influence Asian political behavior?
</p>
<p>
In sum, I advance a cautionary tale about the pitfalls of ignoring ethnic, linguistics, and religious diversity among Asian Americans. I also underscore the conditions under which such disparate ethnic groups can be brought together under a common Asian label. By providing a more comprehensive portrayal of this fast-growing demographic group, my dissertation research has important implications for how race, ethnicity, and politics (REP) scholars should approach the study of diverse ethnic and racial categories.
</p>
<p>
Other than Political psychology, American politics, and REP, my research interests also include:
<ul>
<li>Experimental social science</li>
<li>Groups and identities</li>
<li>Intergroup cooperation</li>
<li>Partisanship</li>
<li>Social influence</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
I have also supervised and worked with a diverse group of students from various backgrounds and interests for several semesters while fielding my studies through the Center for Behavioral Political Economy (CBPE) at Stony Brook University. Most importantly, I would not have been able to carry out some of my studies as effectively without the insurmountable commitment and contribution by some of my incisive undergraduate research assistants &mdash; especially, Farzeen Siddiquee ('22) and Hasna Naseer ('22), who are now pursuing to become a legal voice for those in need after their successful careers at Stony Brook University.

    <img style="width:300px;height:400px;" src="images/w_lu3.jpg"> Whether one turns to Aristotle's description of humans as naturally 'political (<i>polis-</i>}) animals' or Confucius' view that humans are defined by the socially and culturally prescribed responsibilities and moral obligations, we humans have long been deemed a group-oriented species by many ancient and modern thinkers. Hence, it is not surprising to many that social groups, especially racial groups in American politics, are central in studies of political behavior.
