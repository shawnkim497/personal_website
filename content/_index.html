<h1>About me</h1>
</div>
<p>
I am an advanced Ph.D. candidate in the <a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu/polsci/"><strong>Department of Political Science </strong></a>at Stony Brook Univeristy (dissertation to be defended by May 2023). My research, broadly speaking, focuses on race, ethnicity and politics (REP), political behavior, and political psychology in American politics. While my general interests are not confined to any particular racial or ethnic group, my dissertation research specifically focuses on Asian Americans. As the fastest-growing demographic group in America, recent scholarly interests in Asian Americans' political behavior have increased markedly. Nevertheless, there remains considerable skepticism over more fundamental questions about Asians in the US due to minimal evidence provided by previous research. In particular, my dissertation tackles the following questions: how do Asians in the US form an inclusive collective ingroup given considerable heterogeneity between different subgroups and how does it link to their political behavior? My dissertation consists of three papers each of which considers the "pan-ethnic" nature of Asian Americans as a group and its political and other behavioral consequences through a variety of methodological approaches.
</p>
<p>
Thus, I seek to tell a cautionary tale about pitfalls of overlooking a key detail about Asian Americans &mdash; distinct ethnic / national-origin groups being embedded in an imposed group moniker. By providing a more comprehensive portrayal of this fast-growing demographic group, my dissertation research has important implications for how we as REP scholars should approach examining such cases.
</p>
<p>
Other than Political psychology, American politics, and REP, my research interests also include:
<ul>
<li>Experimental social science</li>
<li>Groups and identities</li>
<li>Intergroup cooperation</li>
<li>Partisanship</li>
<li>Social influence</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
I have also supervised and worked with a diverse group of students for several semesters while fielding my studies through the Center for Behavioral Political Economy (CBPE) at Stony Brook University. From this experience, I have learned how to effectively manage a team of students from various backgrounds and interests. Most importantly, I would not have been able to carry out some of my studies as effectively without the insurmountable commitment and contribution by some of my incisive undergraduate research assistants &mdash; especially, <a href="https://givingday.stonybrook.edu/o/stony-brook-university/i/stony-brook-giving-day-2022/s/sbupolisci">Farzeen Siddiquee ('22) and Hasna Naseer ('22)</a>, who are now pursuing to become a legal voice for those in need after their successful careers at Stony Brook University.

    <img style="width:300px;height:400px;" src="images/w_lu3.jpg"> Whether one turns to Aristotle's description of humans as naturally 'political (<i>polis-</i>}) animals' or Confucius' view that humans are defined by the socially and culturally prescribed responsibilities and moral obligations, we humans have long been deemed a group-oriented species by many ancient and modern thinkers. Hence, it is not surprising to many that social groups, especially racial groups in American politics, are central in studies of political behavior.
