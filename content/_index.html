<h1>About me</h1>

<p>
My research, broadly speaking, focuses on race, ethnicity and politics, political behavior, and political psychology in American politics. Whether one turns to Aristotle's description of humans as naturally 'political (<i>polis-</i>}) animals' or Confucius' view that humans are defined by the socially and culturally prescribed responsibilities and moral obligations, we humans have long been deemed a group-oriented species by many ancient and modern thinkers. Hence, it is not surprising to many that social groups, especially racial groups in American politics, are central in studies of political behavior.

Nevertheless, some recent research developments, especially in Asian American political behavior, have generally disregarded a key detail <span>&#8212;</span> distinct groups being embedded in an imposed group moniker. Thus, in my dissertation, I seek to tell a cautionary tale about pitfalls of this and provide a more comprehensive portrayal of this fast-growing demographic group. Specifically, my dissertation research focuses on the following questions: how do Asians in the US form an inclusive collective ingroup and how does it link to their political behavior? My dissertation consists of three papers each of which considers the "pan-ethnic" nature of Asian Americans as a group and its political and other behavioral consequences through a variety of methodological approaches.
