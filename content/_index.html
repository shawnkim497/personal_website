<p>I am a doctoral student at Stony Brook University in the <a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu/polsci/">department of political science</a>. I am primarily interested in behavioral political economy, “the psychologically informed, economic analysis of behavior and its effects in the political arena,” as Schnellenbach &amp; Schubert (2015) defined. I use several methods, including experiment, formal modeling, agent-based modeling, and machine learning. In addition, I focus on determining how a person’s belief about how others will and should behave shapes decisions in different contexts like redistribution, cooperation, and other political behaviors. I am also the <a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/cbpe/">Center for Behavioral Political Economy</a> lab manager at Stony Brook University.</p>

This file is left intentionally empty by default to be backward compatible with initial theme setup.

Although the theme has advanced a little bit and it now allows to specify the content on the main page (even if the list of posts/articles is not intended).
This can be:
- with the list of posts/articles (default: `mainSections = ["post"]) or
- without the list of posts/articles (by setting `mainSections = [""]`)

Markdown supported, ie:

```
